APP WIDE

- make a simple front end html welcome page with big buttons directing the user to the different dashboards
- Setup authentication so user can only access from authenticated google account
- Bump django from 3.0.3 to 3.0.7 #1 Security Fix prompted by github


CASE DASHBOARD

- although deleted cases from today are removed from dashboard, deleted cases from yesterday aren't. Perhaps there should be a check in place to see if all open cases match and if they don't, then we need to make a lot of api calls by running '/populateallcases' or something like it
- rename repository and folders so its obvious that cases and sales are separate apps within the same project
- adjust the readme.md to update with information for case dashboard

SALES DASHBOARD

- salesdashboard db should get full phone calls and opportunities so that it can be stored and retrieved similar to case dashboard
- point calculation should only be done on db data after the fact so the API calls are simplified and the process takes less time
- datepicker applied to sales dashboard
- in general, large overhaul to sales dashboard to emulate the improvements that were done in the case dashboard
