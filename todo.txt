---ToDo---

APP WIDE

- make a simple front end html welcome page with big buttons directing the user to the different dashboards
- Setup authentication so user can only access from authenticated google account
- Bump django from 3.0.3 to 3.0.7 #1 Security Fix prompted by github


CASE DASHBOARD
- rename repository and folders so its obvious that cases and sales are separate apps within the same project
- adjust the readme.md to update with information for case dashboard
- show which dates are available in the datepicker

SALES DASHBOARD

- group selector applied to sales dashboard so we can also see all opportunity data not just from the sales team.
- provide week/month data perhaps?
- show which dates are available in the datepicker
