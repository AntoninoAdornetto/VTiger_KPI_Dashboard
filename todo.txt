APP WIDE

- make a simple front end html welcome page with big buttons directing the user to the different dashboards
- Setup authentication so user can only access from authenticated google account

CASE DASHBOARD

- deleted cases should be removed from case dashboard. Perhaps it could check if cases "date_modified" is older than 30 minutes, it should be deleted? Need to investigate
- pretty up the case dashboard display CSS!
- choose the date automatically for case dashboard for day, week, and month data based on the date selected
- manually do a one time upload of all cases from the past year to the django db
- see if the full case upload will make it easy to show all cases that aren't closed or resolved to see a total number and then we can forgo any other api calls
- setup celery to auto-populate the case data once every 10 minutes (update all most recent 100 cases)
- rename repository and folders so its obvious that cases and sales are separate apps within the same project
- adjust the readme.md to update with information for case dashboard

SALES DASHBOARD

- salesdashboard db should get full phone calls and opportunities so that it can be stored and retrieved similar to case dashboard
- point calculation should only be done on db data after the fact so the API calls are simplified and the process takes less time
- datepicker applied to sales dashboard
- in general, large overhaul to sales dashboard to emulate the improvements that were done in the case dashboard
